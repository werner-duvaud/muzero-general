# MuZero General

A commented and [documented](https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general/wiki/MuZero-Documentation) implementation of MuZero based on the Google DeepMind [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265) (Nov 2019) and the associated [pseudocode](https://arxiv.org/src/1911.08265v2/anc/pseudocode.py).
It is designed to be easily adaptable for every games or reinforcement learning environments (like [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)). You only need to add a [game file](https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general/tree/master/games) with the hyperparameters and the game class. Please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general/wiki/MuZero-Documentation) and the [example](https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general/blob/master/games/cartpole.py).

MuZero is a state of the art RL algorithm for board games (Chess, Go, ...) and Atari games.
It is the successor to [AlphaZero](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815) but without any knowledge of the environment underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model of the environment and uses an internal representation that contains only the useful information for predicting the reward, value, policy and transitions. MuZero is also close to [Value prediction networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03497). See [How it works](https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general/wiki/How-MuZero-works).

* [ ] Support of stochastic environments
* [ ] Support of more than two player games
* [ ] RL tricks (Never Give Up,  Adaptive Exploration, ...)

## Demo

All performances are tracked and displayed in real time in [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) :

Testing Lunar Lander :

## Games already implemented

* Cartpole      (Tested with the fully connected network)
* Lunar Lander  (Tested in deterministic mode with the fully connected network)
* Gridworld     (Tested with the fully connected network)
* Tic-tac-toe   (Tested with the fully connected network and the residual network)
* Connect4      (Slightly tested with the residual network)
* Gomoku
* Twenty-One / Blackjack    (Tested with the residual network)
* Atari Breakout

Tests are done on Ubuntu with 16 GB RAM / Intel i7 / GTX 1050Ti Max-Q. We make sure to obtain a progression and a level which ensures that it has learned. But we do not systematically reach a human level. For certain environments, we notice a regression after a certain time. The proposed configurations are certainly not optimal and we do not focus for now on the optimization of hyperparameters. Any help is welcome.
